# C Operators 
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
C divides the operators into the following groups:
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators
# Arithmetic Operators
| Operator	          |Name	                                  | Description	Example	 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| +	Addition	        | Adds together two values              | x + y                |
| -	Subtraction      | 	Subtracts one value from another     | 	x - y               |
| *	Multiplication	  | Multiplies two values	                | x * y                |
| /	Division	        | Divides one value by another          | x / y                |
| %	Modulus	         | Returns the division remainder	       | x % y                |
| ++  Increment	     | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x                  |
| --  Decrement	     | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x                  |
# Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:
>> Note: The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:
# Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.
In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:
